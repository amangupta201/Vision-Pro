# Vision Pro

The AI-Powered Vision Pro is an advanced application designed to improve the quality and aesthetics of images using a variety of image processing techniques. This project aims to provide users with a comprehensive set of tools for enhancing images, whether for personal, professional, or creative use.

The application supports multiple enhancement features including:

Image Clarity Improvement: Sharpens images to bring out finer details and improve overall clarity.

Color Correction: Adjusts colors to make images look more natural and vibrant.

Filters and Effects: Applies artistic filters to give images a unique look and feel.

Super-Resolution: Enhances the resolution of images, making them appear clearer even when enlarged.

Denoising: Removes unwanted noise from images to produce cleaner results.

Sharpening: Enhances edges and details to give images a crisper appearance.

Contrast Enhancement: Adjusts the contrast levels to highlight key features in the image.

Deblurring: Reduces blur in images, especially in cases of motion blur or out-of-focus areas.

HDR Compression: Balances high dynamic range (HDR) images to avoid overexposed or underexposed areas.

Artistic Filters: Transforms images with creative filters that mimic various artistic styles.

Grayscale Conversion: Converts images to grayscale with options to fine-tune the result.

Image Stitching: Combines multiple images to create panoramic views or larger compositions.

Watermarking: Adds watermarks to images for branding or copyright protection.

Background Removal: Isolates subjects from their backgrounds, making it easy to create cutouts or place subjects in different scenes.

Cartoonify: Applies a cartoon-like effect to images by using techniques like bilateral filtering, edge detection, and adaptive thresholding.

The project is implemented using a combination of traditional image processing algorithms and AI techniques, ensuring high performance and quality. The app is designed with a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily upload images, apply enhancements, and save the results in their desired format.
